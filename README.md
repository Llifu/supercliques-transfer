# An Improved Clique-picking Algorithm for Counting Markov Equivalent DAGs via Super Cliques Transfer

This is the repository of the " An Improved Clique-picking Algorithm for Counting Markov Equivalent DAGs via Super Cliques Transfer" paper. Our experiments are based on the clique-picking algorithm from https://github.com/mwien/CliquePicking
