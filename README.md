## The SC-Trans and ICP algorithm

This is the repository of the " An Improved Clique-picking Algorithm for Counting Markov Equivalent DAGs via Super Cliques Transfer" paper. Our experiments are based on https://github.com/mwien/CliquePicking.

### Experimental details
The instances are undirected connected and chordal graphs generated by minimal triangulation method. The folder `instances` contains two subfolders `Varying numbers of graph vertices` and `Varying graph densities`, which are of the same name of the subsections of section 7 in our paper. The instances in the subfolders are named as `<number> <density> <x>`.
